# Logo Setup Instructions

## ✅ Logo Integration Complete!

The code has been updated to use your logo image. Now you just need to add your logo file.

## 📁 Where to Add Your Logo

Replace the existing logo file at:
```
public/images/logo.svg
```

## 🎨 Logo Requirements

### For Navbar Logo:
- **Format**: SVG (recommended) or PNG
- **Size**: Square format (e.g., 512x512px, 1024x1024px)
- **Background**: Transparent
- **File name**: `logo.svg` or `logo.png`

### For Favicon (Browser Tab Icon):
The same logo will be used as the favicon automatically!

## 🔄 If You Have a PNG Logo Instead

If your logo is PNG format, update line 85 in `components/ui/navbar.tsx`:

Change:
```tsx
src="/images/logo.svg"
```

To:
```tsx
src="/images/logo.png"
```

And also update `app/layout.tsx` line 13:
```tsx
{ url: '/images/logo.png', type: 'image/png' },
```

## 📝 What's Been Updated

✅ Navbar now displays your logo image
✅ Favicon (browser tab icon) uses your logo
✅ Open Graph image (social media sharing) uses your logo
✅ Twitter card image uses your logo
✅ Hover effects preserved on logo

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Add your logo file to `public/images/logo.svg` (or `logo.png`)
2. Refresh your browser
3. Your logo will appear in:
   - Navigation bar
   - Browser tab (favicon)
   - Social media shares

## 💡 Tips

- SVG format is recommended for crisp display at any size
- Make sure your logo looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
- Test the logo at different sizes (navbar is 40x40px)
